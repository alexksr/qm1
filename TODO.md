# TODO
## Recent
- [ ] only one class for operators (only OperatorTD) since it implements all features of the OperatorConst class
- [ ] make wavefunction class compatible with time-dependence or add a WavefunctionTD class
- [ ] add predefines Hamiltonian like HamiltonOp for the time dependent case from a TD potential
# BACKLOG
- [ ] make pip package
# DONE
- [x] add observables functionality to return the exp-vals or variances of a wave func wrt some operator
- [x] OperatorTD works
- [x] auto generate plots via a `show` method
- [x] easy-to-use predefine operators
- [x] add MWEs
- [-] add spin?
